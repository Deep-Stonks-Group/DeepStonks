# Simulation Environment

This will be a real-time stock buy/sell simulator. It will use live market data and a simulated bank account to test our algorithm performance. This will need to
be able to buy/sell/hold stocks, and make calls to the algorithms in order to determine if they will actual be profitable.

1. This will be to simulate actual trading with different algorithms in real time.
2. Needs to be able to get real price data.
3. Needs to be able to keep track of which stocks itâ€™s currently holding, and how much money.
4. Needs to be able to make decisions based on an algorithm to buy/sell/hold a stock.
