# DeepStonks
This is a github project that will be used to share code and collaborate on algorithmic trading and attempting to predict stock and cryptocurrency market behaviors. This project consists of a few main portions:

1. GUI
2. Simulation
3. Data Retrieval
4. Testing
5. Stock Forcasting Research
6. Lessons

## GUI

This will be used to visualize live data and algorithm performance.

## Simulation

This will be used to test algorithms in a simulated live stock market.

## Data Retrieval

This will be used to get stock data, and format it so that it can be easily implemented in the research algorithms.

## Testing

This will be used to divide data into testing/training. It will also take testing labels, and predictions and produce a systemized results so that algorithms
can be easily compared.

## Stock Forcasting Research

This will be where the different research projects are stored.

## Lessons

This will be where I will be posting basic tutorials and content from each of our lessons.
