# Front End Design

The purpose of this is to create a tool for our team to quickly view different stocks, and visualize the predictions of different algorithms. At the very base
level this tool will need to pull live data for any stock and to display this in an easy to understand way. To understand more on what this tool should do, see
Yahoo Finance's stock visualizing tool:

Once we have the basic version, we will then want it to be able to visualize the results of our different algorithms and filter out stocks based on that. 

- This will be a tool that at first will gather relevant information from the web and show it to us.
  1. Stock prices
  2. Recommendation
  3. News
- As we build out our algorithms this will need to incorporate our algorithms and allow us to filter based on certain algorithms, 
and show the results of running certain methods.
